In this chapter, the details of each element of the user interface are explained.

.. _live-signal-plot:

Live Signal Plot
################

The last 100 data points from the data aquisition card will appear here. Use this window to check the expected
output of coils. The y-axis will adjust to account for increasing amplitude.  Also, in order to use the keyboard
controls, this plot needs to be clicked at least once before pressing the keys.

Parametrized Output Visualization
#################################

This contains a full three-dimensional representation of the output signal. The plot is interactive and the view can
be changed by clicking, dragging, and scrolling out.

The three signals output to the coils form this representation of the magnetic field in 3D space. This should always
show a perfect circle. The microwheel structure follows this path, and thus this circle can be imagined to be like
the wheel. The circle is split up into three segments for easier visualization of direction and tilt.

    :align: center


The colors represent the direction of the rotation. The wheel will always start on green (green means go), then go to
red, leaving the bottom half of the wheel blue. Using this key, we can conclude that the wheel in the image above is
rotating clockwise and to the right and we should expect to see the same under the microscope if the coils are hooked
up correctly.
See :ref:`the calibration section <Calibration>` to ensure that the actual magnetic field looks like the
visualization.


.. _param-tree:

Parameter Tree
##############

.. image:: /images/ParamTree.png
    :align: center

This section of the interface allows for direct interaction of the signal parameters and a calibration mode. Each
parameter can be:

1. Clicked on to manually type in a value
2. Adjusted using the up and down arrows on the right side
3. Reverted to the default value of that session using the orange arrow button on the far right side

In the calibration section, the output mode can be toggled between "Normal" and "Calibration". See the
:ref:`Calibration <calibration>` section for more detail on this functionality.

.. note:: The values in this section are temporary - they will reset to their defaults after MuControl is restarted.
  To change the default values, use the settings window.

.. _settings:

Settings
########

.. image:: /images/SettingsWindow.png

This window allows the user to change important settings for the *National Instruments (NI)* input and output cards. It
can be accessed in File -> Settings. The **Default Signal Values** section also allows for default value changes between
restarts in the :ref:`Parameter Tree <param-tree>`. After calibration, the Z-Coefficient should be set here. These
values will only be used **after the next restart of the application**. Below is a description of each setting and what it does.

Read Parameters
---------------
DAQ Name
  The name of the data aquisition card, assigned by the **NI-DAQmx** drivers. By default the device name is :code:`Dev1`.
  This name can be found by opening up the **NI-MAX** software that was installed with the drivers, clicking on devices
  on the left, and viewing the connected devices. This will be the same as the name used in the previous MATLAB control
  code.

.. warning:: If this name is not correct, MuControl cannot "see" the card!

.. _read-channel-list:

Read Channel List
  A list of the input channels being used on the physical card. To find out what channels your wires are plugged into,
  google the model name of the card that you have and match the wires to their channel name. By default, this list is
  configured to read from six channels (for six coils). If your setup only has 5, simply delete the one that is not being
  used. These channels will be the same that were in the previous MATLAB control code.

.. warning:: Be sure to keep the formatting, with square brackets around the list and small quotes around each channel:
  :code:`['ai0','ai1','ai2','ai3','ai4']`

DAQ Read Rate
  The rate at which the data aquisition card collects samples in Hz (or samples per second). This value should be okay
  at its default, as it provides a good balance between application performance and signal resolution.
Read Chunk Size
  The number of points that are retrieved from the data buffer and plotted. This value should also be okay at its default.

Write Parameters
----------------

Function Gen. Name
  The name of the function generator name, assigned by the **NI-DAQmx** drivers. By default the device name is
  :code:`cDAQ1Mod1`. The first part of the name "cDAQ1" refers to the chassis, while the "Mod1" refers to the module
  housed within. This name can be found in the same manner as the **DAQ Name**.

.. warning:: If this name is not correct, MuControl cannot "see" the card!

Write Channel List
  A list of the output channels being used. The numbers of the channels are printed on the physical device where the
  wires are inserted. By default: :code:`[0, 1, 2]` correspond to coils [x, y, z]. Be sure to keep the same
  formatting if any numbers are changed!
Generation Rate
  The rate at which the function generator generates voltage values in Hz (or samples per second). The default, 8000, is
  very likely sufficient for signal frequencies 10-150 Hz from my experiments using an oscilloscope to check the quality
  of the waveforms. If this value is changed, I recommend changing it by increments of 1000. It is also required that the
  number is divisible by 10.

.. warning:: The **Generation Rate** setting was removed in MuControl v1.1 as it is an advanced setting that shouldn't need 
  to be changed.

Default Signal Values
---------------------

To adjust the default signal parameters between application restarts, modify these values. For further explanation, see
:ref:`parameters <params>`.
