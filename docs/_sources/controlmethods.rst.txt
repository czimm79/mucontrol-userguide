Control Methods
***************

Apart from manually adjusting the :ref:`signal parameters <params>` in the :ref:`Parameter Tree <param-tree>`, they
can also be adjusted using the keyboard or a gamepad (controller).

.. warning:: The parameters are not range limited. Everyone's setup may require different voltage
  multipliers. Take care that a large current is not supplied to your coil setup that may cause excessive heating
  and/or damage! (The National Instruments cards, however, will automatically shut down if an unreasonable voltage is
  requested)

Keyboard
########

The controls for operating the :ref:`signal parameters <params>` using the keyboard are listed in the center of the
application - with one caveat. In order to enable the keyboard presses, the :ref:`live signal plot<live-signal-plot>`
must be single clicked at least once so it is the active portion of the application. This is implemented so other parts
of the application may be manipulated using the keys.

Gamepad (Controller)
####################

The controller support in MuControl is plug-and-play. If no controller is detected, everything behaves as normal.
However, if a controller is connected before starting the application, it is active and its buttons can be used to
modify the signal parameters. Most controllers should work as long as they wired and have an "Xbox" layout. The
**Logitech Gamepad F310** is a cheap and pre-tested option that requires no setup besides plugging it in. It can be
purchased from Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-940-000110-Gamepad-F310/dp/B003VAHYQY/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=logitech+gamepad&qid=1566330291&s=gateway&sr=8-3
