This application was written in Python 3.7 primarily using open source libraries pyqtgraph_ (for efficient live 2D and 3D
plots), numpy_ (for the mathematical heavy lifting), and nidaqmx_ (for the API to talk to the physical cards). For Qt
bindings for the GUI, PyQt5_ was used. The installer and application packaging was performed with help from PyInstaller_
and fbs_.

For further technical information on how the application works, please contact me at czimmermann@mines.edu and I can
add you to the private GitHub code repository for MuControl, where you can see all the code and detailed documentation.
If anyone is so inclined and interested in Python, I would also welcome collaboration for any new features or any bugs
that may appear!

Lastly, I welcome any input on how I could make this application better or easier to use.
